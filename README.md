    <h1>Process Scheduling Algorithms Web Page</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the Process Scheduling Algorithms web page! This page provides a comprehensive overview of several process scheduling algorithms commonly used in computer science. You can access the live page <a href="https://schedulingalgorithms.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SJF (Shortest Job First):</strong> Illustrates the Shortest Job First scheduling algorithm.</li>
        <li><strong>LFJ (Longest Job First):</strong> Demonstrates the Longest Job First scheduling algorithm.</li>
        <li><strong>Priority Scheduling:</strong> Displays Priority Scheduling with both preemptive and non-preemptive modes.</li>
