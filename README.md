<h1>Process Scheduling Algorithms Web Page</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Process Scheduling Algorithms web page! This page provides a comprehensive overview of several process scheduling algorithms commonly used in computer science. You can access the live page <a href="https://schedulingalgorithms.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
        <li><strong>SJF (Shortest Job First):</strong> Illustrates the Shortest Job First scheduling algorithm.</li>
        <li><strong>LFJ (Longest Job First):</strong> Demonstrates the Longest Job First scheduling algorithm.</li>
        <li><strong>Priority Scheduling:</strong> Displays Priority Scheduling with both preemptive and non-preemptive modes.</li>
        <li><strong>FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve):</strong> Introduces the First-Come-First-Serve scheduling algorithm.</li>
        <li><strong>Round Robin:</strong> Highlights the Round Robin scheduling algorithm.</li>
        <li><strong>HRRN (Highest Response Ratio Next):</strong> Explores the non-preemptive Highest Response Ratio Next scheduling algorithm.</li>
</ul>
